    description: >
      Table contains the first five accepted transactions per store ID based on the
      timestamp when the transaction happened (in ascending order).
      Those transactions might be handled by different devices.
    columns:
      - name: store_id
        description: Id of the store where the transaction was performed

      - name: transaction_order
        description: >
          Ordered number of the accepted transaction per store based on the
          timestamp when the transaction happened (in ascending order). Only the
          first 5 transactions are kept, i.e. transaction_order <= 5. Transactions
          with transaction_order > 5 are filtered out to keep the table smaller for
          further transformations.
        tests:
          - not_null
